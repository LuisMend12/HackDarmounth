üß† BrainFlux
BrainFlux is a cutting-edge real-time neural data visualization tool built with C++ and ImGui, designed to help researchers and engineers intuitively explore and analyze complex brain activity data.
Originally developed for HackDarmouth, BrainFlux focuses on rendering high-speed neuronal spike and brainwave data with responsive, interactive controls, making insights easier to uncover.

üöÄ Inspiration
Neural data ‚Äî especially from interfaces like Neuralink‚Äôs N1 implant ‚Äî can be overwhelming and complex.
We wanted a powerful, lightweight visualizer that makes sense of this data in real time without sacrificing speed, flexibility, or clarity.

üß© What It Does
Visualizes real-time neural spike data and synaptic patterns

Provides smooth, interactive graphs using ImGui

Handles large-scale brainwave datasets with minimal latency

Offers an intuitive interface designed for researchers and engineers

üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It
Visualization: Developed a C++ application using ImGui for high-performance, real-time data rendering.

Data Preprocessing:

Noise Filtering: Used Python to remove static noise and amplify meaningful signals from raw brainwave audio data.

Lossy Compression: Applied lossy compression to reduce dataset size for faster processing and lightweight storage.
